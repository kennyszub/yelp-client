## Yelp

This is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/docs/read/JSON).

Time spent: `10`

### Features

#### Required

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
   - [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
   - [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
- [x] Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
   - [x] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
   - [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
   - [x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. Optional: implement a custom switch
   - [x] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
   - [x] Display some of the available Yelp categories (choose any 3-4 that you want).

#### Optional

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results
   - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results
- [x] Filter page
   - [x] Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
   - [x] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is here: http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list (Links to an external site.)
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

### Basic Yelp client

This is a headless example of how to implement an OAuth 1.0a Yelp API client. The Yelp API provides an application token that allows applications to make unauthenticated requests to their search API.

### Next steps

- Check out `MainViewController.m` to see how to use the `YelpClient`.
- Augment the search method in the `YelpClient` with whatever search parameters you want to support.

### Sample request

```
self.client = [[YelpClient alloc] initWithConsumerKey:kYelpConsumerKey consumerSecret:kYelpConsumerSecret accessToken:kYelpToken accessSecret:kYelpTokenSecret];
        
[self.client searchWithTerm:@"Thai" success:^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, id response) {
   NSLog(@"response: %@", response);
} failure:^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, NSError *error) {
   NSLog(@"error: %@", [error description]);
}];
```
